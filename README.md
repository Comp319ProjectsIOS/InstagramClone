# InstagramClone

This project was created for the Comp 319B, Introduction to Mobile Development(IOS) course in Koc University.

In this project a replica of Instagram was created using Swift storyboards. The functionalities of adding friend, posting photos, liking and commenting on freinds photoes are avaliable.
There is also feed functionality similar to Instagram where you are displayed new photoes of people who do not yet follow.
